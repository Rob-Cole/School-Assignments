These are a collection of the assignments I worked on in my Introduction to Progamming course.

The problems that were assigned were based off of the lessons taught in class where we were introduced 
to basic syntax and logic structures used in programing.The topics begin with creating simple programs 
that complete arithmatic tasks, and result in creating an executable program.
